# Pendulum_Stability
This is a project from our NCSU Gears summer research program. With the background knowledge of reinforcement learning in machine learning, we explore the optimal model to keep the pendulum on the cart stable (without toppling over). Additionally, we enhance the model's generality by expanding the acceptable range of initial states.
